Getting Started
---------------

> **Note:** Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

    # using npmnpm start# OR using Yarnyarn start

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

    # using npmnpm run android# OR using Yarnyarn android

#### For iOS

    # using npmnpm run ios# OR using Yarnyarn ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly. This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1.  Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2.  For Android: Press the R key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (Ctrl + M on Windows and Linux or Cmd âŒ˜ + M on macOS) to see your changes!
3.  For iOS: Hit Cmd âŒ˜ + R in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
